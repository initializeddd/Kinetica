Kinetica is a **free and open-source 3D modeling application** built from the ground up for **low-poly art creation**. Designed with simplicity, performance, and modularity in mind, it empowers artists and developers alike—no coding required to use, but easy to extend if you want to.

> **Work in Progress** — Public from day one to invite collaboration, feedback, and support. Not all features are complete, but every commit brings us closer!

## Vision

- **Artist-first interface**: Clean, intuitive, and distraction-free.
- **Fast & lightweight**: Built with a custom GPU backend (no OpenGL dependency).
- **Plugin-ready**: Modular architecture for tools, exporters, and renderers.
- **Cross-platform**: Windows, macOS, and Linux (coming soon).
- **Made for low-poly**: Optimized workflows for hard-surface and stylized modeling.
